# Assignment 1 - Foundations of Advanced Front-end (Next.js - Pages Router)

## What this contains
- A Next.js project (pages router) with:
  - Home page (`pages/index.js`) with Counter and Todo components.
  - Features page (`pages/features.js`) with ContactForm demonstrating form handling & conditional rendering.
  - About page (`pages/about.js`).
  - Components: `components/Counter.js`, `components/Todo.js`, `components/ContactForm.js`, `components/Nav.js`.
  - Global styles in `styles/globals.css`.

## How to run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes for submission
- This project uses the **pages** router (not the app router), so Vercel/GitHub Pages deployment should work without the "Couldn't find pages or app" error if you upload the repo root.
- Make sure `package.json`, `pages/`, and `next.config.js` remain at the repository root.

Good luck â€” let me know if you want extra features or different styling.
